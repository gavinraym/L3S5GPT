<!-- FIRST PROMPT - Use this prompt to create a navigation bar that the
    user can use to browse your content.

    Create an html navigation bar with three choices: 'Blog', 'Pets' and 'Me'. Selecting on a choice
    should display a div below the nav bar where I can add html content.

    What kind of results did you get from ChatGPT? Was it what you expected?
    What kind of styles did it add automatically?

    Now it is time for you to get creative! What else might you want to add
    to your page? Here are some suggestions. Here is an already made prompt
    to get you going.

      EXAMPLE PROMPT:
        - Write some html that can replace the content of Blog with a three post blog. 
        Each post should have a title, a date, and some text about what my pets are 
        doing. My pets are... 
            - a rowdy dog named 'Buddy'
            - a lazy cat named 'Mittens'
            - a boring fish named 'Goldie'

    Add two more prompts that you come up with here, that replace the other navigation 
    choices: "Pets" and "Me". After adding the ChatGPT responses to your program, 
    describe what each prompt changes on your page and if it is different
    from what you were imagining.

      - Write some html that can replace the content of Pets with ...


        --- Describe what your prompt did and if it is what you expected. ---


      - Write some html that can replace the line <p>HTML content for Contact goes here...</p>
