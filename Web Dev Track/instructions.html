            <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The ChatGPT for Fun Coding class is all about learning how to use a cool tool called ChatGPT to create computer code that does what you want it to do! In this class, you'll learn how to tell ChatGPT what you want your code to do using everyday words, so you don't need to memorize tricky code or worry about getting the syntax right. On this track, you will create web sites!</p>
			    <p>By the end of the class, you'll be a pro at using ChatGPT to make your own code and you can use your new skills to make all sorts of cool things! This class is perfect for kids who are just starting to learn about computer programming, or for anyone who wants to have fun making code in a new and exciting way!</p>

			 <h2>Class Expectations</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>This class is made up of a series of HTML files that include starter prompts demonstrating how ChatGPT can be leveraged to create web pages. As a student in this class, you are expected to run the starter prompt and add the resulting code to your project. After adding the code, you will find a commented section where you can explain what the generated code looks like and how you might change it.</p>
                <p>For each file, you are expected to come up with five prompts that change your code in some way and record them in the file with an explaination of what it does. Each file has some example prompts that you can use as is or change to your liking. If tried and explained about, these prompts do count toward the 5 prompt requirment.</p>			
                <p>It's important to note that you do not have to keep the code generated from the prompts. You are free to go in new directions after you have recorded the prompts. The main goal of this class is to help you understand how to use ChatGPT to generate executable code and create web pages.</p>
                <p>To succeed in this class, you should want to learn the basics of programming with HTML and be comfortable using a computer. You will also need to be able to follow instructions and complete assignments. If you have any questions or need extra help, please don't hesitate to ask your teacher. They are here to help you learn and succeed!</p>

            <h2>Time To Get Started</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Thank you for taking this class. We are sure you will enjoy learning about ChatGPT and how it can be used to create web pages. Remember, if you have any questions or need extra help, please don't hesitate to reach out to your teacher. They are here to support you and help you achieve your goals. </p>
                <p>Now let's get started! Open the first project, <a href="p1-basic-elements.html">P1 Basic Elements</a>, which will display as a white page in your browser until you start adding code. Also open the file in VS Code, and look for the starting prompt at the top. Finally open ChatGPT in a new tab, and paste in the starter prompt. Now you are ready to start experimenting with code!</p>
