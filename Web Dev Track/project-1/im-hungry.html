<!-- FIRST PROMPT - Use this promtp to create a web page about your favorite meal.
    
I'm a beginner programmer who is making a web page about my favorite meal. 
Give me html code with the following format:

  - A main header with the name of the meal: 
        'Hot Dog Mummy'

  - A subheader that describes the meal:
        'Ruler of the condiment kingdom!'

  - A paragraph about why I love it:
        'Not only does it taste so good, but it is spooky too.'

  - An image of the meal:
        '../assets/hot-dog-mummy.jpg'

  - A list of what ingredients are in the meal
        'hot dog, ketchup, pancake mix'

      How does your page look? My guess is, it has a very simple layout. That's
      because we only add 5 elements to the prompt: header, subheader, 
      paragraph, image, list. 

      Now it is time for you to get creative! What else might you want to add
      to your page? Here are some suggestions. You can ask ChatGPT these prompts
      for ideas.

      - Add a link to my social media site: https://www.linkedin.com/in/i-am-gavin-ray/
      - Animate the title so that it bounces left and right.
      - Make the image a little bigger and centered in the screen.

      Add more prompts that you come up with here. Also, describe what each prompt
      changes on your page, and if you are going to keep the changes or branch the
      conversation.
